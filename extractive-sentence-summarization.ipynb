    "# Extractive Sentence Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I provide a python class for creating a full-sentence summary of document. Sentence summary is useful for document summary applications where it is beneficial to give users a quick sense of what is contained in the document to determine if they wanted to read further. There are two different categories of text summarization techniques: extractive and abstractive. Extractive techniques generally require less data, are unsupervised, and \"extract\" sentences from the document. Conversly, abstrative techniques require labeled training data, are supervised, and create summaries made up of generated, rather than extracted sentences. Methods, which are implemented in the open source package `sumy`, are all extractive and include KL-sum, Edmundson, LexRank, LSA, and random.\n",

    "## Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**LSA**  \n",
    "An unsupervised technique that relies on Singular Value Decomposition of a term-sentence matrix with TFIDF weights. See [Generic Text Summarization Using Relevance Measure and Latent Semantic Analysis](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/IDA/text_summary.pdf) for additional details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edmundson**  \n",
    "A heuristic technique that considers word frequency, cue words (eg significant, impossible, hardly), title words, and word location. See [New Methods in Automatic Extracting, 1969](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/edmonson69.pdf) for additional details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kullbackâ€“Leibler**  \n",
    "An unsupervised technique that selects sentences by minimizing the divergence between word distribution in the document as a whole and the sentences in the summary. See [Exploring Content Models for Multi-Document Summarization, 2009](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N09-1041) for additional details.\n",
    " \n",
    "**LexRank**  \n",
    "An extension of Google's Page Rank algorithm to sentence selection where sentences are nodes and similarity scores are edges. See [LexRank: Graph-based Lexical Centrality as Salience in Text Summarization, 2004](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html) for additional details.\n",
